# Control-and-Analyse-Plugin
An OctoPi plugin to analyse and control the 3D-printer.


## Setup the developing environment on octopi
In case of developing your plugin directly on your Raspberry Pi running OctoPi, you’ll only need to activate the oprint virtual environment:
´´´
$ source ~/oprint/bin/activate
(oprint) $ octoprint --help
Usage: octoprint [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

[...]
´´´


Setting up a local development environment will most likely be less painful than developing directly on the Pi. So do yourself the favor and do that instead where possible.
